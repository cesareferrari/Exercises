"""
Implement the Quicksort algorithm to sort a list of numbers in ascending order
using recursion.
The function doesn't modify the original list, but returns a new sorted list.

Algorithm:
1. choose a pivot
2. move everything less than the pivot to one side
3. move everything more than the pivot to the other side
4. repeat steps 1 to 3 on the left hand side and right hand side of the partition
